// I intend to implement a neat ~blogging system,
// with a few specific goals:

// drag-and-drop image/movie insertion
// drag, crop, resize, etc.

// the main p0st dynamic is to drag an image
// then comment on it, with possibly more images

// the main page renders (at least a header of) ~25 p0sts
// Which 25 is determined by search terms,
// or if none are entered, p0st youth.

// p0sts can be edited afterward.

// records a lot of metadata.
