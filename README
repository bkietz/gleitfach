gleitfach © Ben Kietzman, 2011

gleitfach is a barebones HTML editing system.
(German for 'sliding box' - rhymes with kite-Bach)


One selected HTML element's immediate children can be edited in 
     a variety of ways: reposition, crop, scale, delete...
     New children can also be created, for example by simply dropping an
     image into the browser window.

The editor mode in use is determined by a single key press, alá GIMP.
     Actions within one editor mode are primarily mouse-based.

By selecting different elements for editing, a document of arbitrary
     complexity can be constructed and modified.

[C-s] saves the webpage without transcription errors. Because .js files
     will be included in such a save, gleitfach will also be available
     for subsequent editing of the page. This can be disabled in favor 
     of saving the resultant HTML content alone, or the user can 
     compress/encode all libraries, images, etc. and prepend them to 
     index.html, yielding a monolithic HTML file. (easier to deal with)
