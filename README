The logger is essentially a wysiwyg html editor, with a system for searching/rendering the results.
Most of the editor's pieces were already there, and what wasn't I have coded.
The editor, now that it's compiled, can be used for many things.
Make it instance-able and put it into deb, github etc.
	(In short, canibalize it for a different project- call it traum or something.)
Code the logger using traum- it will be easy.


I could perhaps just extend javascript to contain some of the methods I want (like perspective...)

cdf kicks ass. It's mathematica, just mark-up instead of wysiwyg
        ... except I gotta figure out how to edit one without mathematica.
	It would be excellent to incorporate CDF into the logger somehow.
