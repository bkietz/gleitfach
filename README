Release notes for the ❘z〉Logger, ©Ben Kietzman, 2011

	Below is a description of the logger's
	functionality and limitations.


**************
  ❘z〉Logger
**************
	
	This is a logger I wrote to take notes,
		keep research logs, store todo lists, etc.
		≈ a blogging CMS, with a few specific goals: 
			→drag-{reposition, crop, resize}
			→drag&drop image/movie insertion
			→search/metadata management for p0sts
			→can run locally or remotely
			~→integration with Mathematica, Mendeley...
	
	The main page shall render ~25 p0sts
		(or at least a header/thumbnail thereof)
	Specifically which 25 is determined by search 
		terms or (if none are entered) p0st youth.
	For new p0sts, an HTML editor is loaded. This
		editor should be as general as possible, and
		should implement one dynamic with particular
		fluidity and versatility:
			→drag&drop an image and comment thereupon
	p0sts shall be editable afterward, and the logger
		should record a lot of metadata for later
		convenience when searching.
