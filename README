gleitfach is a barebones HTML editing system.
(German for 'sliding box' - rhymes with kite-Bach)






I want gleitfach to be simple, but very general.

One element is selected as the parent window.
Its children (immediate children only) may be
moved/cropped however you like, within constraints
set by the user. These can include:
                        -must be fully inside the parent's {LTRU}side
                        -may not be fully outside the parent's {LTRU}side
                        -may not be shrunk such that content overflows
                        -webkit transforms not permitted

The user can also edit CSS styles directly using gleitfach.
Any element can be given class or id which can be referenced 
in the page's stylesheet, which is appended to the header.
The user can edit this using gleitfach. Similarly, the user 
can edit the javascript context using gleitfach.
$('<style/>').appendTo('head').text('img { border:5px solid black }')

Children can also be created/deleted within the 
selected parent. Several methods are available,
from efficient   {      creating a simple text node,
                        creating a simple image node,
                        ...     }
to general        {     contextual pop-around menus,
                        type in HTML tag type explicitly ('div','pre', ...),
                        ...     }.

There are several save modes:
		-Ctrl-s should save the webpage with *no* transcription 
			errors and *no* key-event overriding in code.
		-By default, the editor will be contained in the saved page,
			thereby allowing subsequent editing of the page. This can
			be disabled in favor of saving the resultant HTML content alone.
		-The user can aslo choose to compress/encode all libraries, images, 
			etc. and prepend them to index.html, yielding a monolithic HTML file.
